All the questions are generated based on the exam.xml. So you don't need to hard code it, and you don't need to have html knowledge. Inside the exam.xml, I explained how to use this form.

In the main page, I use iframe to load each question by the question type that means each type of question has a specific file to handle the logic, and the main page(index) will collect the info sent by the file.  So, it's easy in the future to expand another types of question and combine them together.

The Exam Summary button allows you to overview all the questions and quick jump to question.  You can view how many you answered, jump to question, go back or grade the exam.

If you grade your exam without answer all your questions. It will give you a alert.

You have the option to put a image with your answer, and it's perfectly responsive!
